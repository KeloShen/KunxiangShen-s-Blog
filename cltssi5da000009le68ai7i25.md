### About me

First, let me introduce myself. I am an undergradate in second year and major in software engineering. I am Chinese and i am studying in China now. My school's name is Xidian University which is located in Xi'an.

I have been to Cambridge University to participate in a Deep Learning Study Project in February, 2024. Our researcher just had a ZOOM meeting for us to give some advice to apply for Phd. I want to record it and share it with others. By the way, my English is not really good so maybe you will feel some kind of weird when you read my sentences, so please forgive me.

### Advice

* You should know whether or not you are interested in the field you are learning. If you are not truly loving it, the supervisior and your group mates will find it. Do not just apply for the degree because you want to get it. You need to truly love it!
    
* Phd is mainly about academic. You should know about it in advanced.
    
* If you are not sure about apply for a Phd or a master degree. You can try the programe called CDT. It is not popular in our country, China. This is my first time heard about this when researcher talked about it in the meeting.
    
    [A CS CDT Programe in Cambridge for example](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/pcphpdcms).
    
* You need to look for your interesting field and your favourite supervisor. You need to read papers from the supervisor. Then, you need to commnicate with him and participate in the group, collaborate with your groupmates and then decide whether or not to apply for this group's programe.
    
* When you are writing your application, please remember that you should't use the ChatGPT. GPT makes your texts look like written from a native speaker but you are not actually. What you need to do is that show your the sincerity of scientific research and love of this field, some opinions on the projects done by teachers.
    

### Appreciate

I want to appreciate to Professor Nic and Researcher Filip. They left me unforgettable memories of my studying in Cambridge.
